# Amazon and Vine

### Overview

For this assignment we took a TON of data from Amazon and filtered it using spark (which was actually pretty neat).  Here we compared paid reviews sponsored by Vine to reviews that weren't paid for.

### Results

The results were pretty different than what I expected; I expected the paid reviews to be much more biased than the unpaid reviews.  I also expected to see a lot more paid reviews in the data.  Total reviews were 37475.  We saw that there were 37385 unpaid reviews in the chosen category, and of those 37385 about 40% (~14670) were 5 stars.  For paid reviews, there was a shockingly small number with 90  and of those paid reviews nearly half (44) were 5 stars.

### Summary

I would have thought that the paid reviews would have much more 5 stars than the unpaid reviews, but I guess video gamers are not swayed by a free product. Or there were not enough paid reviews to have a large enough data set to compare.  90 to 37000 isn't exactly even.  Sponsoring more reviews would definitely help bump the numbers up for the paid review data pool, but it could also invite more bias in regards to 5 star reviews.  That being said, nearly 40% of unpaid reviews were 5 stars which is much much higher than I anticipated.
